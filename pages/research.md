# Research

I work at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science. I do research and teach at the University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona (UPF), Spain. I spent some time in the [AI/ML group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) and currently work with [Prof. Christopher Summerfield](https://humaninformationprocessing.com/) and am affiliated with the Center for Brain and Cognition ([CBC](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc)).

My machine learning expertise includes reinforcement learning and control, optimisation and probabilistic machine learning.

I was a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at [Secondmind.ai](https://www.secondmind.ai/) (ex Prowler.io) in Cambridge, UK, from February 2018 to January 2022. I was also a postdoctoral researcher in [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s group at Aalto University, Helsinki, from November 2020 to January 2022.

I completed a PhD under the supervision of [Maneesh Sahani](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~maneesh/) at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), London, UK. In my thesis work, I focused on auditory perception and explored how Bayesian theories of perception could account for various perceptual phenomena revealed in controlled psychophysical experiments. I also developed non-parametric methods for statistical data analysis. My undergraduate studies were in electrical engineering (Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France) and cognitive science (Ecole Normale Superieure, France).
