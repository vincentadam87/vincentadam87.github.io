I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Gatsby Computational neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/).
I have a broad interest in understanding how humans learn flexible representations of their environments and how these representations are used in further computations. In my thesis work, I focused on auditory perception and explored how Bayesian theories of perception could account for various perceptual phenomena revealed in controlled psychophysical experiments. I'm also broadly interested probabilistic machine learning which both provides the framework to rigorously describe perception as an inference under uncertainty and to derive tools for statistical data analysis.
