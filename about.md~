#I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Gatsby Computational neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/).
#I have a broad interest in understanding how humans build flexible representations of their environments and how these representations are #used in further computations. In my thesis work, I focused on auditory perception and explored how Bayesian theories of perception could #account for various perceptual phenomenon. I'm also broadly interested probabilistic machine learning which both provides the framework to #rigorously describe perception as an inference under uncertainty and to derive tools for statistical data analysis.
