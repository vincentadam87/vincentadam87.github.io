# Consulting

I like to **bridge the gap between theory and practice** and to solve real world problems using **machine learning** techniques. 

I have worked as a ML researcher/consultant for various companies: Swhere (defunct), [Secondmind.ai](https://www.secondmind.ai/), [Solvo.ai](https://www.solvo.ai/).

I did private ML teaching for [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.com/)'s quants, via [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/).
