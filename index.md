I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [AI/ML group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) at University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain. My research interests lie broadly around 
* reinforcement learning and control
* optimisation
* probabilistic machine learning

I was a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at [Secondmind.ai](https://www.secondmind.ai/) (ex Prowler.io) in Cambridge, UK, from February 2018 to January 2022. I was also a postdoctoral researcher in [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s group at Aalto University, Helsinki, from November 2020 to January 2022. 

I completed a PhD under the supervision of [Maneesh Sahani](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~maneesh/) at the [Gatsby Computational neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), London, UK.
In my thesis work, I focused on auditory perception and explored how Bayesian theories of perception could account for various perceptual phenomena revealed in controlled psychophysical experiments. I also developped non-parametric methods for statistical data analysis. My undergraduate studies were in electrical engineering (Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France) and cognitive science (Ecole Normale Superieure, France).
