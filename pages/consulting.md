# Consulting


### What I do
I help teams bridge the gap between theory and practice by bringing rigorous machine learning expertise to real-world problems.


My consulting work focuses on problem formulation, scientific direction, and rapid prototyping, combining strong theoretical foundations with hands-on experience to quickly assess feasibility and identify promising modelling approaches.


I create the most value through focused, high-impact collaboration, combining close engagement with independent analysis.

### Past experience
I have worked as an ML researcher/consultant for various several companies, including Swhere (defunct), [Secondmind.ai](https://www.secondmind.ai/), [Solvo.ai](https://www.solvo.ai/).

I have also provided private ML teaching for [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.com/)'s quants, via [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/).
