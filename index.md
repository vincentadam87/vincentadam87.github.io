I am a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at [Prowler.io](https://www.prowler.io/) since February 2018.
I hold PhD from the [Gatsby Computational neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/).
I have a broad interest in cognitive science, probabilistic machine learning and approximate inference.
In my thesis work, I focused on auditory perception and explored how Bayesian theories of perception could account for various perceptual phenomena revealed in controlled psychophysical experiments. I also developped non-parametric methods for statistical data analysis.

### **Projects and other activities**

I participated in the development of the scientific application [Daydreaming](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainydroid.daydreaming), with financial help from the city of Paris through [Science en poche](https://iscpif.fr/projects/science-en-poche/). I started a scientific [blog](https://vincentadam87.wordpress.com/) that I plan to revive soon. With the Gatsby Unit we participated in a Kaggle hosted seizure detection [challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-detection) and ranked 9/200 and we presented our work at a seizure focused conference. I've been involved in consultancy work with the company [Swhere](http://www.swhere.com/) applying machine learning techniques to solve business problems.
